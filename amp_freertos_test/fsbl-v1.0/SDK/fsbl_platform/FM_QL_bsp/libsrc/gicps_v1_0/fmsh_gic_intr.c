* This file contains the interrupt processing for the driver for the FMSH
* Interrupt Controller.  The interrupt processing is partitioned separately such
* that users are not required to use the provided interrupt processing.  This
* file requires other files of the driver to be linked in also.
*
* The interrupt handler, FGicPs_InterruptHandler, uses an input argument which
* is an instance pointer to an interrupt controller driver such that multiple
* interrupt controllers can be supported.  This handler requires the calling
* function to pass it the appropriate argument, so another level of indirection
* may be required.
*
* The interrupt processing may be used by connecting the interrupt handler to
* the interrupt system.  The handler does not save and restore the processor
* context but only handles the processing of the Interrupt Controller. The user
* is encouraged to supply their own interrupt handler when performance tuning is
* deemed necessary.

*
* This driver assumes that the context of the processor has been saved prior to
* the calling of the Interrupt Controller interrupt handler and then restored
* after the handler returns. This requires either the running RTOS to save the
* state of the machine or that a wrapper be used as the destination of the
* interrupt vector to save the state of the processor and restore the state
* after the interrupt handler returns.

* This function is the primary interrupt handler for the driver.  It must be
